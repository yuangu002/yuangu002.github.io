## Me
### Current
I am a software engineer at Google, focusing on applying privacy-preserving technologies to Android Ads. For more professional details, you can connect me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gu-yuan/).

I am currently learning Android development, distributed system, and user privacy.

My current reading/watching/learning list (usually out-of-date):
- [End to end argument](https://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/endtoend.pdf)
- [Android Security Internals](https://github.com/rambhawan/Computer-Compiler-Lang/blob/master/Android%20Security%20Internals.pdf)
- [Policy-based information flow control](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jyang2/papers/p631-yang.pdf)
- [MIT 6.824 Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/)
- [DDIA](https://dataintensive.net/)

### Past
- I interned at Cloudera for summer 2021, where I worked on the next-gen distributed storage system, [Apache Ozone](https://ozone.apache.org/). I built a full-stack monitoring system (UI, APIs, CLI) to visualize disk usage.
- I was a teaching assistant for CMU's [Cloud Computing course](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~msakr/15619-f21/). I was leading design and maintenance of the "cloud storage" module.
- During undergraduate years, I have built several (now defunct) Android apps, including but not limited to, photo-sharing social media, city guide service, and COVID-19 mobile tracker, all of which gained some local attentions (and revenues), but failed to maintain consistent growth. In my master's degree, I studied how to build robust software systems at scale.
- Proud alumni from Carnegie Mellon University (2021), William & Mary (2020) and Beijing No.8 High School (2014, 2017).

### Misc
- Basketball player since 8, idolizing Allen Iverson for life.
- If you happen to speak Chinese, I would rather go by 顾源. You can also find me on [知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/people/gu-yuan-46-28) or [豆瓣](https://www.douban.com/people/159427915/).
