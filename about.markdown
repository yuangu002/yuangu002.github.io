## Me
I am a software engineer at Google, focusing on applying privacy-preserving technologies to Android Ads. For more professional details, you can connect me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gu-yuan/).

A few things about me:
- Basketball player since 8, idolizing Allen Iverson for life.
- Read books and watch movies on history, political satire, and biography.
- Current technical focus: Android development, distributed system, and user privacy.
- Proud alumni from Carnegie Mellon University (2021), William & Mary (2020) and Beijing No.8 High School (2017).
- If you happen to speak Chinese, I would rather go by 顾源. You can also find me on [知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/people/gu-yuan-46-28) or [豆瓣](https://www.douban.com/people/159427915/).
