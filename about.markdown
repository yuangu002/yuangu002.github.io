### Past
- I interned at [Cloudera](https://cloudera.com) for summer 2021, where I worked on the next-gen distributed storage system, [Apache Ozone](https://ozone.apache.org/). I built a full-stack monitoring system (UI, APIs, CLI) to visualize disk usage.
- In Dec 2021, I obtained a master's degree in computer systems from Carnegie Mellon University. Funded by the merit-based tuition scholarship from [INI](https://ini.cmu.edu), I studied how to build robust software systems at scale. I was a teaching assistant for CMU's [Cloud Computing course](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~msakr/15619-f21/) in fall 2021.
- Before that, I completed my bachelor's degree from William & Mary in Virginia. I graduated *summa cum laude* in 3 years with a double major in computer science and pure mathematics.
- I am a proud alumnus from Beijing No.8 High School (2017) and Beijing No.8 Middle School (2014).

### Misc
- I have been playing basketball since 8, idolizing Allen Iverson for life.
- If you happen to speak Chinese, I would rather go by 顾源. You can also find me on [知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/people/gu-yuan-46-28) or [豆瓣](https://www.douban.com/people/159427915/).
