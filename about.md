### Current
I am a software engineer at Google, Core ML. I work on auto-prompting tools for LLM developers. Previously, I was a part of the [Android Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/android) project. See more about my routine [here](/purpose).

### Past
You can find all my past titles on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gu-yuan/) or [resume](/assets/resume.pdf). Below are some of fun facts that I am particularly proud of:
- I am an open-source contributor. At Google, I built frameworks and services for a system module in Android 13/14. At Cloudera, I contributed to the next-gen storage system, Apache Ozone, as a summer intern.
- I graduated *summa cum laude* in three years for bachelor's degree, where I completed two majors in computer science and pure mathematics.
- I love teaching. I have been teaching English to Chinese high school students. In particular, I helped them prepare standardized tests (TOEFL/SAT) for their college application. I also teach computer science: I was a teaching assistant for [CMU's cloud computing course](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~msakr/15619-f21/) in fall 2021.
- I love writing, in all forms. I won a Chinese national essay competition for 5 consecutive years. I was once a poet: I composed many Chinese traditional poems in middle school.
- I am a proud alumnus from Beijing No.8 High School (2017) and Beijing No.8 Middle School (2014).

### Misc
- I have been playing basketball since 8, idolizing Allen Iverson for life. I share some of my random basketball clips on IG ([@guyuan002](https://www.instagram.com/guyuan002/)).
- If you happen to speak Chinese, I would rather go by 顾源. You can also find me on [知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/people/gu-yuan-46-28) or [豆瓣](https://www.douban.com/people/159427915/).
