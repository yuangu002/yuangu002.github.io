## Me
### Current
I am a software engineer at Google, working on the [privacy sandbox initiative on Android](https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/android). See more about my routine [here](/purpose).

**If you know opportunities to build cool stuffs, please [let me know](mailto:guyuan002@gmail.com).**

### Past
You can find all my past titles on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gu-yuan/) or [resume](/assets/resume.pdf). Below are some of fun facts that I am particularly proud of:
- I graduated *summa cum laude* in three years for bachelor's degree, where I completed two majors in computer science and pure mathematics.
- I love teaching. I have been teaching English to Chinese high school students. In particular, I helped them prepare standardized tests (TOEFL/SAT) for their college application. I also teach computer science: I was a teaching assistant for [CMU's cloud computing course](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~msakr/15619-f21/) in fall 2021.
- I love writing, in all forms. I won a Chinese national essay competition for 5 consecutive years. I was once a poet: I composed many Chinese traditional poems in middle school.
- I am a proud alumnus from Beijing No.8 High School (2017) and Beijing No.8 Middle School (2014).

### Misc
- I have been playing basketball since 8, idolizing Allen Iverson for life. I share some of my random basketball clips on IG ([@guyuan002](https://www.instagram.com/guyuan002/)).
- If you happen to speak Chinese, I would rather go by 顾源. You can also find me on [知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/people/gu-yuan-46-28) or [豆瓣](https://www.douban.com/people/159427915/).

## This blog
This blog is completely personal. It stores all my writings across a variety of topics. Technical posts are written in English, while non-technical posts in Chinese.

I may migrate some of technical-related posts to [Medium](https://medium.com/@guyuan002) as I practice to become a better English writer, which is blank for now. :)

Some BS red tape: opinions are my own blah blah blah...
