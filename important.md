As a life-long basketball player, I learnt two things from basketball: 
- Life is all about having a purpose. 
- The meaning of life is to fulfill these purposes by deliberate practice.

Below are a few purposes that I think important in my early 20s to focus and execute on:
- Technical learning and growth, with a focus in AI/LLM.
- Physical learning and growth, with a focus in bodybuilding and basketball.
- Lifestyle learning and growth, with a focus in writing and investment.

My mottos:
- Carpe Diem, seize the day
- Excellence means extra works
- There is only one true heroism in the world: to see the world as it is, and to love it

My monthly reading list (2024/06):
- Deep Work by Cal Newport
- LangChain
- [IIya's 30 papers](https://arc.net/folder/D0472A20-9C20-4D3F-B145-D2865C0A9FEE)
