As a life-long basketball player, I learnt two things from basketball: 
- Life is all about having a purpose. 
- The meaning of life is to fulfill these purposes by deliberate practice.

Below are a few purposes that I think important in my early 20s to focus and execute on:
- Engaged work and consistent learning at Google.
- Bodybuilding, weight loss, and basketball.
- Build connections and influence others.

My mottos:
- Carpe Diem, seize the day
- Excellence means extra works
- There is only one true heroism in the world: to see the world as it is, and to love it
