As a life-long basketball player, I learnt two things from basketball: 
- Life is all about having a purpose. 
- The meaning of life is to fulfill these purposes by deliberate practice.

Below are a few purposes that I think important in my early 20s to focus and execute on:
- Engaged work and consistent learning at Google.
- Bodybuilding, weight loss, and basketball.
- Build connections and influence others.

My mottos:
- Carpe Diem, seize the day
- Excellence means extra works
- What hurts more, the pain of hard work or the pain of regret?
- There is only one true heroism in the world: to see the world as it is, and to love it

People who inspire me:
- Basketball players: Allen Iversion, Dwyane Wade, Wang Zhizhi
- Zhang Jike, Chinese table tennis player
- Lei Jun, founder and CEO of Xiaomi
- Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba
- Jay Chou, Mandopop singer
- My parents
