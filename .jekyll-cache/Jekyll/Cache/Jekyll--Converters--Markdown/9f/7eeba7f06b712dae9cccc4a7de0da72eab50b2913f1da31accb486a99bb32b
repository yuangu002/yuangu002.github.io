I"²<p>As a life-long basketball player, I learnt two things from basketball:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Life is all about having a purpose.</li>
  <li>The meaning of life is to fulfill these purposes by deliberate practice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are a few purposes that I think important in my early 20s to focus and execute on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Engaged work and consistent learning at Google.</li>
  <li>Bodybuilding, weight loss, and basketball.</li>
  <li>Build connections and influence others.</li>
</ul>

<p>My mottos:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Carpe Diem, seize the day</li>
  <li>Excellence means extra works</li>
  <li>There is only one true heroism in the world: to see the world as it is, and to love it</li>
</ul>
