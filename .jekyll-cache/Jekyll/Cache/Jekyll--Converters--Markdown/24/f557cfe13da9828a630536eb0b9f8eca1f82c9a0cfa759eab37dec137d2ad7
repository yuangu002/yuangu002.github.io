I"]*<p>A continuation of <a href="/effective-engineer">[Effective Engineer] Mindset (Part 1)</a>, this article of the series focuses on execution techniques that help enforce those mindsets.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-4-accelerate-iteration-speed">[Chapter 4] Accelerate iteration speed</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The faster you can iterate, the more that you can learn what works and what doesn’t.</li>
  <li>Because learning compounds, the sooner you iterate fast, the faster your learning rate is.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Help engineers make small, incremental changes rather than large features.</li>
  <li>When making small changes, it helps trace down bugs and enforce fine-grained A/B testing.</li>
  <li>Gated large feature behind a configuration flag.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="investing-in-time-saving-tools">Investing in time-saving tools.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Faster compilation cycle shorten the validation loops when writing code.</li>
  <li>Using REPL (read-eval-print loop) to verify expressions in an interactive programming environment.</li>
  <li>Invest in those tools early on with a potential upfront cost rather than pay the tax every iteration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="shorten-debugging-and-validation-loop">Shorten debugging and validation loop</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make a minimal, reproducible test case that triggers the bugs with only necessary configs.</li>
  <li>Test and debug with a tight feedback loop.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="master-programming-environment">Master programming environment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Get proficient with text editors and IDE (code reformatting, navigating, version control, etc).</li>
  <li>Be expert in at least one high-level language with powerful built-in abstractions (Python over Java, C/C++).</li>
  <li>Get familiar with Linux shell commands.</li>
  <li>Keyboard over mouse.</li>
  <li>Run unit tests that only associated with your changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="unblock-non-engineering-bottlenecks">Unblock non-engineering bottlenecks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dependency upon other teams: overcommunicate to align with priorities.</li>
  <li>How to obtain approval from senior leadership: use informal coffee chat/office hour to build relationship over time.</li>
  <li>Review process from PM/legal: plan ahead.</li>
  <li>Some of these are out of engineer’s control, so some companies set up the role of TPMs to help cross-team communications.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-5-measure-what-you-want-to-improve">[Chapter 5] Measure what you want to improve</h2>
<p>Engineers should relentlessly measure and quantify metrics to improve product quality.</p>

<h3 id="use-metrics-to-drive-progress">Use metrics to drive progress</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Focus on right things. Metrics confirm that your product changes actually achieve your objectives.</li>
  <li>Help guard against future regressions.</li>
  <li>Drive forward progress. Make sure the thing that you are optimizing is going at the right direction.</li>
  <li>Measure the effectiveness, compare the leverage against other activities, and prioritize accordingly. See <a href="/effective-engineer">prioritization</a> section.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pick-the-right-metrics">Pick the right metrics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Maximize impact: profit per <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> in economics, etc.</li>
  <li>Actionable: use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rate/percentage</code> over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gross/total</code>.</li>
  <li>Responsive yet robust: Updates quickly enough to give feedback over a period of time. Example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xxx</code> over the last week is more responsive than over the last month, while more rebust than over the last hour.</li>
  <li>In terms of team management, engineers can also pick some metrics over the other:
    <ol>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Productivity per week</code> over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hours per week</code>: Long working hours decreases productivity, resulting in “undertime”.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Outstanding bug fixed</code> over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Total bug fixed</code>: Prioritize impactful bugs over trivial bugs.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="instrument-the-system">Instrument the system</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Metric is top-level strategy; instrumentation is low-level implementation detail.</li>
  <li>More instrumentations provides better visibility of the system.</li>
  <li>Create dashboard to visualize instrumentations over time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="internalize-common-numbers">Internalize common numbers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keep the table at hand: <a href="https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832">Latency numbers that every engineer should know.</a></li>
  <li>These back-of-the-envelop calculations can quickly estimate performance metrics of your design.</li>
  <li>Help spot anomalies in data measurements.</li>
  <li>Common useful numbers can benchmark your current design and scope for improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="prioritize-data-integrity">Prioritize data integrity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Log the accurate, unbiased data. Wrong data is worse than no data.</li>
  <li>Usually metrics-related code is less robust than feature code.</li>
  <li>Be skeptical about data integrity: Data can get dropped in network traffic, bugs in data collection pipelines or dashboard, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-6-validate-ideas-early-and-often">[Chapter 6] Validate ideas early and often</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Optimize for feedback ASAP helps get <em>right</em> things done.</li>
  <li>Resonate with a more recent idea: <a href="https://publiclab.co/build-in-public">build in public</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="find-low-effort-ways-to-validate-the-work">Find low-effort ways to validate the work</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Identify the scariest, the riskiest, the most uncertain part of the project, and validate it first.</li>
  <li>Build a MVP/prototype: the version of a product that allows a team to collect <em>maximum</em> amount of <em>validated</em> learning about customers with the <em>least</em> effort.</li>
  <li>The MVP can be creative. Dropbox “fakes” a placeholder button for Google account login and monitors its click-through rate, to validate whether the feature can gain tractions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="continuously-validate-product-changes-via-ab-testing">Continuously validate product changes via A/B testing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A random subset of users see a change, while everyone else doesn’t.</li>
  <li>Using variable control, A/B testing validates that any significant change in metrics can be solely attributed to the product change.</li>
  <li>A/B testing turns the black box of of user behavior into understandable, actionable knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="beware-the-one-person-team">Beware the one-person team</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Leverage design doc, code reviews, or informal coffee chat to keep other engineers aware of your progress.</li>
  <li>Keep code changes small and incremental.</li>
  <li>Design API interface/protobuf first to surface early issues.</li>
  <li>Solicit buy-in with conversations for large features.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="build-feedback-loop-for-any-decision">Build feedback loop for any decision</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Formulate a hypothesis, design an experiment to test it, define metrics, run the experiments, learn from the results.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-7-improve-project-estimation-skills">[Chapter 7] Improve project estimation skills</h2>

<h3 id="use-accurate-estimates-to-drive-project-planning">Use accurate estimates to drive project planning</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keep the deadline constant and deliver what is possible.</li>
  <li>Decompose the project into granular tasks.</li>
  <li>Set a hard deadline for minimal delivery and an internal deadline for stretch goals.</li>
  <li>While one engineer can finish one task, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> engineers can’t deliver <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> tasks with the same efficiency because of communication overhead, new hire ramp-up, etc.</li>
  <li>Once you have an estimate, validate it against historical data.</li>
  <li>Use timeboxing to restrict with open-ended tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="budget-for-the-unknown">Budget for the unknown</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There are always uncertain problems that we fail to account for when estimating. Several minor yet unexpected tasks compound and wreak havoc with the schedule.</li>
  <li>Separate effective work time from total calendar time, as many non-engineering duties may slip in. When setting schedules, build in buffer time for the unexpected interruptions.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 engineering day = 2 calendar days</code> is a ballpark benchmark.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="define-specific-goals-and-measurable-milestones">Define specific goals and measurable milestones</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A well-defined goal helps scope the project: separate must-haves from nice-to-haves.</li>
  <li>It also builds clarity and alignment across key stakeholders.</li>
  <li>A concrete milestone keeps the team honest and tracks current progress. Rather than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">almost done</code>, a measurable milestone looks like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">features X, Y, Z by a completion date</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reduce-risks-early">Reduce risks early</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A common risk is system integration, where functional subsystems are integrated together but fails as a whole.</li>
  <li>Build an end-to-end scaffolding (skeleton) and test it early on.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dont-sprint-in-the-middle-of-marathon">Don’t sprint in the middle of marathon</h3>
<h4 id="working-overtime-doesnt-produce-linear-impact">Working overtime doesn’t produce linear impact</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Productivity decreases with additional hours worked</li>
  <li>When you realize you can’t make the deadline, you are more behind schedule than you think, because you likely underestimated the entire projects, not just the previous months.</li>
  <li>Working extra hours can burn out team members and hurt team morale.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="working-overtime-can-be-used-as-a-compromised-option-if-you">Working overtime can be used as a compromised option, if you:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Communicate with the team on why working overtime is necessary.</li>
  <li>Revise the plan and schedule to adapt to the new reality.</li>
  <li>By any means, it’s not an excuse for not practicing project estimation skills.</li>
</ul>
