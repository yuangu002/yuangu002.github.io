<p>You can find all my past titles on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gu-yuan/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="/assets/resume.pdf">resume</a>. Below are some of fun facts that I am particularly proud of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> in three years for bachelor‚Äôs degree, where I completed two majors in computer science and pure mathematics.</li>
  <li>I love teaching. I have been teaching English to Chinese high school students. In particular, I helped them prepare standardized tests (TOEFL/SAT) for their college application. I also teach computer science: I was a teaching assistant for <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~msakr/15619-f21/">CMU‚Äôs cloud computing course</a> in fall 2021.</li>
  <li>I love writing, in all forms. I won a Chinese national essay competition for 5 consecutive years. I was once a poet: I composed many Chinese traditional poems in middle school.</li>
  <li>I am a proud alumnus from Beijing No.8 High School (2017) and Beijing No.8 Middle School (2014).</li>
</ul>

  <li>I have been playing basketball since 8, idolizing Allen Iverson for life. I share some of my random basketball clips on IG (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/guyuan002/">@guyuan002</a>).</li>
  <li>If you happen to speak Chinese, I would rather go by È°æÊ∫ê. You can also find me on <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/gu-yuan-46-28">Áü•‰πé</a> or <a href="https://www.douban.com/people/159427915/">Ë±ÜÁì£</a>.</li>

<h2 id="this-blog">This blog</h2>
<p>This blog is completely personal. It stores all my writings across a variety of topics. Technical posts are written in English, while non-technical posts in Chinese.</p>

<p>I may migrate some of technical-related posts to <a href="https://medium.com/@guyuan002">Medium</a> as I practice to become a better English writer, which is blank for now. :)</p>
