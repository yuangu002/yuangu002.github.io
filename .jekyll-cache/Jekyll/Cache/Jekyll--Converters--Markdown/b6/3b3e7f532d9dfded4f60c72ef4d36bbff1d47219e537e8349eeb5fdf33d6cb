I"ü$<p><a href="https://www.effectiveengineer.com/book">The Effective Engineer</a>, written by Edmond Lau, is the Bible for software engineer. I summarize key points of this book (with minimal insights from me) and break it down into three major steps of practicing to become an effective engineer: adopting the right mindset, execute religiously, and build long-term value. This article is about part 1: the mindset.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: although a summary like this can help, I highly recommend reading it for more insights, as some examples in this book can inspire you to reflect your scenario at work.</p>

<p>Edmond provides an example that beginners can start off with.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Divide your checklist to <strong>Doing</strong>, <strong>Today</strong>, and <strong>This week</strong> sections.</li>
  <li>Each item should have an ETA (estimated time to complete): use 25 minutes as a unit and mark each item with the estimated number of units.</li>
  <li>Every morning, spend a few minutes planning: moving some items from <strong>This week</strong> to <strong>Today</strong>.</li>
  <li>When you are free during the day or right before your ‚Äúconcentrated time block‚Äù starts, moving items from <strong>Today</strong> to <strong>Doing</strong>. Keep them short!</li>
  <li>Monday morning/Sunday night, do a 30-minute review session to scope out <strong>This week</strong> section for this week and retrospect on items that were not executed well in the last week.</li>
</ul>
