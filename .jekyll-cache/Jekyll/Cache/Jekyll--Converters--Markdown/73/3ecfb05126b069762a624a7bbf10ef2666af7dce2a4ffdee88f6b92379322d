<h3 id="past">Past</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I interned at Cloudera for summer 2021, where I worked on the next-gen distributed storage system, <a href="https://ozone.apache.org/">Apache Ozone</a>. I built a full-stack monitoring system (UI, APIs, CLI) to visualize disk usage.</li>
  <li>I was a teaching assistant for CMU’s <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~msakr/15619-f21/">Cloud Computing course</a>. I was leading design and maintenance of the “cloud storage” module.</li>
  <li>During undergraduate years, I have built several (now defunct) Android apps, including but not limited to, photo-sharing social media, city guide service, and COVID-19 mobile tracker, all of which gained some local attentions (and revenues), but failed to maintain consistent growth. In my master’s degree, I studied how to build robust software systems at scale.</li>
  <li>Proud alumni from Carnegie Mellon University (2021), William &amp; Mary (2020) and Beijing No.8 High School (2014, 2017).</li>
