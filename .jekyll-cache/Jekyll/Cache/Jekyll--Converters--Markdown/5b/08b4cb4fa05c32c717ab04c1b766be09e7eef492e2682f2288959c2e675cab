<p>I am a software engineer at Google, Core ML, where I build LLM-augmented tools to accelerate LLM adoptions across teams at Google, with a focus on prompt optimization and AI agents. Before that, I was a part of the <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/android">Android Privacy Sandbox</a> project. See more about my routine <a href="/purpose">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="past">Past</h3>
<p>You can find all my past titles on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gu-yuan/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="/assets/resume.pdf">resume</a>. Below are some of fun facts that I am particularly proud of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I am an open-source contributor. At Google, I built frameworks and services for a system module in Android 13/14. At Cloudera, I contributed to the next-gen storage system, Apache Ozone, as a summer intern.</li>
  <li>I graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> in three years for bachelor‚Äôs degree, where I completed two majors in computer science and pure mathematics.</li>
  <li>I love teaching. I have been teaching English to Chinese high school students. In particular, I helped them prepare standardized tests (TOEFL/SAT) for their college application. I also teach computer science: I was a teaching assistant for <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~msakr/15619-f21/">CMU‚Äôs cloud computing course</a> in fall 2021.</li>
  <li>I love writing, in all forms. I won a Chinese national essay competition for 5 consecutive years. I was once a poet: I composed many Chinese traditional poems in middle school.</li>
  <li>I am a proud alumnus from Beijing No.8 High School (2017) and Beijing No.8 Middle School (2014).</li>
</ul>
